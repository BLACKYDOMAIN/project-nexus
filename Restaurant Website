Project Name:
Restaurant Website - Login and Signup Page (Front-end Only)

Domain:
Web Development

Level:
Medium

Description:
This project involves creating an attractive and responsive login and signup page using React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The focus is on crafting a visually appealing design with gradient backgrounds, animations, and form validation. The project aims to provide users with an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing interface for authentication.

Key Features:
1. Attractive Design:
The login and signup pages feature a modern design with gradient backgrounds that smoothly transition through multiple colors.
Both pages are enclosed in a sleek, white container with rounded corners and a subtle shadow effect to create a floating appearance.
The design employs Google Fonts for better typography and improved readability.
2. Responsiveness:
The pages are fully responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes.
The layout adjusts gracefully for smaller screens, such as mobile devices, while maintaining usability and aesthetics.
3. CSS Decoration:
Extensive use of CSS for styling and decoration, including hover effects, focus states, and button animations.
The gradient background animation adds a dynamic and engaging visual effect to the page.
Decorative elements such as border radii, box shadows, and custom fonts enhance the overall user experience.
4. Form Validation:
Basic form validation is implemented for both login and signup forms to ensure all fields are filled out before submission.
The signup form includes a password policy that requires the password to be at least 8 characters long and contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character.
Popup messages provide feedback to the user if the form validation fails, enhancing usability.
5. Navigation Links:
The login page includes a link for users to navigate to the signup form if they do not have an account.
Similarly, the signup page includes a link for users to navigate back to the login form if they already have an account.
6. GitHub Repository:
The entire project is organized and uploaded to a GitHub repository named "project-nexus" for version control and collaboration.
The GitHub repository contains the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React files structured in a clean and maintainable manner.
